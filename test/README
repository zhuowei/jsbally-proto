This is a test harness for the z80 unit tests shipped with Fuse.

Pasting the contents of tests.in into the top input box and clicking 'run tests'
should (after hanging your browser for a few seconds) yield something
approximating to tests.expected in the second box.

Known failure cases:
* Contention is not implemented, and consequently timings are a bit off
* Any zero bytes written to memory are omitted from the output (not regarded as
  a change of memory state)
* The undocumented instruction sequences DD00 and DDFD00 takes two M-cycles (and
  consequently only increment R twice) rather than the expected three or four
* Undocumented flags are not set correctly after INI/OUTI/INIR/OTIR
